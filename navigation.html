                <h2>Public Transportation</h2>
                <p>St. Louis offers two main modes of public transportation: The MetroLink and the MetroBus.</p>
                <p>The network is quite extensive between the rail-way and the street bus, but mastering the complete system will take some time.</p>
                <p>Below we'll provide you with a few resources.</p>
                <h3>MetroLink</h3>

                <h2 style="color:white">Ride-Sharing</h2>
                <p>These services have allowed people in hard to reach places to be able to get around just as smoothly.</p>
                <p>Ride sharing has allowed people to utilize their communities resources for transportation instead of conventional state-provided methods.</p>
                <p>Companies such as Uber and Lyft have been competing with taxi companies by providing a competitive business model that is customer oriented.</p>
                <p>We'll attach links below for you to check out their respective services and decide for yourself.</p>
                <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/st-louis/" style="color:white;"><h3>Uber</h3></a>
                <a href="https://www.lyft.com/rider/cities/st-louis-mo" style="color:white;"><h3>Lyft</h3></a>
                <p>Taxi services have also responded to the competition and many have revamped their efforts to maintain their piece of the market share.</p>
                <p><a href="www.stltaxi.com" target="_blank" style="color: white">Stl Taxi</a> has rejoined the fight and offer a competitive service as well.</p>

                <h3>Last Mile Rides</h3>
                <p>More and more cities across the country are popping up with electric scooters and bikes for the public to use.</p>
                <p>These not-so-new commodities are known as "last mile transportation" and they are supposed to make too long to walk, too short to drive treks a bit more manageable for the commuter.</p>
                <p>If you need to get from one bus stop to another in a timely fashion you could benefit from checking these resources out when available.</p>
